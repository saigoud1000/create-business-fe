## Setting up Angular App

1. To install Node on your Linux Machine, follow the instructions for your specific Linux distribution at [Node's Linux Installation Instructions Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and for Windows, download Node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and in command prompt run command below to check node version.

```bash 
npm install @angular/cli -g

For Mac and Linux users you need sudo rights to install the Angular CLI, so type:

Use "sudo" incase of Linux OS.
